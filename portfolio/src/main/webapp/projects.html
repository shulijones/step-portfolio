      <h2> Projects </h2>
      <p> Here are some projects I've worked on. [coming soon] </p>
      <h3 id="tm" onclick="showMore('tm')">Java Task Manager (in progress) ▼ </h3>
      <p class="more-info" id="more-info--tm" onclick="showMore('tm')">
          As a fun side project, I'm working on writing a task manager webapp in Java.
          It's mostly to exercise my Java skills, but also because I feel like there's no
          one perfect task manager that has the functionality I'd like. This is the very
          beginning of an attempt at creating one.
      </p>
      <h3 id="ma" onclick="showMore('ma')"> Constrained Two-Sided Matching Algorithm (in progress) ▼ </h3>
      <p class="more-info" id="more-info--ma">This is for my dormitory. Every year, we have to house about a hundred new first-year
        students, each on one of ten different floors. The new students and the old students both
        have preferences about where they should end up. Over the past year, we've been working as 
        a community to design an algorithm to best accommodate everyone's needs. I've just joined
        the project this summer, so my first task is to clean up the codebase. Then we'll start
        bughunting and innovating on the current solution.
      </p>
      <h3 id="l" onclick="showMore('l')"> Loft Bed ▼ </h3>
      <p class="more-info" id="more-info--l">I knew long before I moved into my dorm room last August that I would want a loft 
        bed to help maximize the available floorspace. My dormitory lets students construct
        their own, if they can do so safely, and provides a wood shop with most of the necessary
        tools. So I went all in: designing, cutting, sanding, staining & varnishing to produce
        a beautiful and very functional final product.
